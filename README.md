# loopback-next-lean-starter


A lean approach for [loopback-next] projects(http://loopback.io/).

Major modifications are:

- Changed code-formatting to eliminate semicolons and trailing commas. 
- Added `openapi-to-graphql-cli` for GraphQL server auto-generation.
- Implemented `dev` and `watch` scripts supporting live reloading.
- Pruned all the linting scripts to a single `lint` script.
- Removed other non-essential scripts.
- Minimized `.vscode` config.
